### Some Learning Notes ###
##### Project Aggregation #####
* Project Aggregation is not Project Inheritance. 
* To achieve project aggregation, module name = artifactId =  directory name
* Benefits of Project Aggregation: mvn commands that run on parent will be run on children as well. 
&nbsp;

##### Project Inheritance Plus Project Aggregation #####
* Benefits: 
  * Avoid redundancy with inheritance
  * Mvn run on parent only
